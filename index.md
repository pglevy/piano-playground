## Who is Sophia?
{: .h3-mktg .border-0 .mb-0}

Hello! My name is Sophia Levy. I’m a wife and mom-of-two living in Montclair, VA, about 30 miles south of Washington D.C.
{: .f3}

After growing up in Jakarta, Indonesia, I graduated from Berklee College of Music in Boston where I studied piano, voice, songwriting, and music synthesis.
{: .f3}

I’ve written and recorded dozens of songs for cable and network television in the U.S. and Asia, and written songs for major label artists in Asia. I also released my own album in Indonesia and starred in a kids show in Singapore.
{: .f3}

After establishing Sophia Music Studio in 2011, I have taught piano and voice to hundreds of students in Northern Virginia and engaged them in a wide variety of performance and recording experiences, including cafes, clubs, restaurants, senior homes, festivals, pop-rock band workshops, competitions, and fundraisers.
{: .f3}

In addition to music, I love cooking, dancing, entrepreneurship, and overall health and wellness.
